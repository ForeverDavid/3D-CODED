# Template-Based Correspondences

This repository contains the source codes for the paper [Correspondences](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~groueixt/correspondences/). The task is to put 2 meshes in point-wise correspondence. Below, given 2 humans scans with holes, the reconstruction are in correspondence (suggested by color).

## Install

#### 

#### Clone the repo

```shell
## Download the repository
git clone git@github.com:ThibaultGROUEIX/template-based-correspondences.git
## Create python env with relevant packages
conda env create -f auxiliary/pytorch-sources.yml
source activate pytorch-sources
conda install pytorch=0.1.12 cuda80 -c soumith #Update cuda80 to cuda90 if relevant
conda install torchvision
```

This implementation uses [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/). Please note that the Chamfer Distance code doesn't work on  [all versions of pytorch](http://pytorch.org/) because of some weird error with the batch norm layers. It has been tested on v1.12, v3 and a specific commit of v4.
#### Pytorch compatibility

| Python/[Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/) | v1.12           | v2  | v3.1  |  0.4.0a0+ea02833 | 0.4.x latest |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|-----:|-----:| ------------- |
| 2.7 | :heavy_check_mark: :+1: :smiley: | :no_entry_sign: :thumbsdown: :disappointed: | :no_entry_sign: :thumbsdown: :disappointed: | :heavy_check_mark: :+1: :smiley: | ðŸš« ðŸ‘Ž ðŸ˜ž |
| 3.6 | :heavy_check_mark::+1: :smiley: | ? | ? | :no_entry_sign: :thumbsdown: :disappointed: | ðŸš« ðŸ‘Ž ðŸ˜ž |

**<u>Recommended</u>** : *Python* **2.7**, *Pytorch* **1.12**

**<u>If you need v4</u>** : 

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch
cd pytorch ; git reset --hard ea02833 #Go to this specific commit that works fine for the chamfer distance
# Then follow pytorch install instruction as usual
```

Developped in python 2.7, so might need a few adjustements for python 3.6. 

#### Install Pymesh in your new Conda environment

Follow the specific repo instruction [here](https://github.com/qnzhou/PyMesh).

Pymesh is my favorite Geometry Processing Library for Python, it's developed by an Adobe researcher : [Qingnan Zhou](https://research.adobe.com/person/qingnan-zhou/).

#### Build chamfer distance

```shell
cd AtlasNet/nndistance/src
nvcc -c -o nnd_cuda.cu.o nnd_cuda.cu -x cu -Xcompiler -fPIC -arch=sm_52
cd ..
python build.py
python test.py
```





## Using the Trained models

The trained models and some corresponding results are also available online :

- [The trained_models](https://cloud.enpc.fr/s/TODO) go in ``` trained_models/```

#### On the demo meshes

Require 3 GB of RAM on the GPU and 17 sec to run (Titan X Pascal). 

```shell
python inference/correspondences.py
```
This script takes as input 2 meshes from ```data``` and compute correspondences in ```results```. Reconstruction are saved in ```data```

#### On your own meshes

You need to make sure your meshes are preprocessed correctly :

* The meshes are loaded with pymesh, which should support a bunch of formats, but I only tested ```.ply``` files. Good converters include [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) and [Pymesh](https://github.com/qnzhou/PyMesh).


* The trunk axis is the Y axis (visualize your mesh against the mesh in ```data``` to make sure they are normalized in the same way). 
* the scale should be about 1.7 for a standing human (meaning the unit for the point cloud is the ```cm```). You can automatically scale them with the flag ```--scale 1```


#### Options 

```python
'--HR', type=int, default=1, help='Use high Resolution template for better precision in the nearest neighbor step ?'
'--nepoch', type=int, default=3000, help='number of epochs to train for during the regression step'
'--model', type=str, default = 'trained_models/sup_human_network_last.pth',  help='your path to the trained model'
'--inputA', type=str, default =  "data/example_0.ply",  help='your path to mesh 0'
'--inputB', type=str, default =  "data/example_1.ply",  help='your path to mesh 1'
'--num_points', type=int, default = 6890,  help='number of points fed to poitnet'
'--num_angles', type=int, default = 100,  help='number of angle in the search of optimal reconstruction. Set to 1, if you mesh are already facing the cannonical 				direction as in data/example_1.ply'
'--env', type=str, default="CODED", help='visdom environment'
'--clean', type=int, default=0, help='if 1, remove points that dont belong to any edges'
'--scale', type=int, default=0, help='if 1, scale input mesh to have same volume as the template'
```



#### Failure modes instruction :

- Sometimes the reconstruction is flipped, which break the correspondences. In the easiest case where you meshes are registered in the same orientation, you can just fix this angle in ```reconstruct.py``` line 86, to avoid the flipping problem. Also note from this line that the angle search only looks in [-90Â°,+90Â°].

- Check the presence of lonely outliers that break the Pointnet encoder. You could try to remove them with the ```--clean``` flag.


#### Last comments

* If you want to use ```inference/correspondences.py``` to process a hole dataset, like FAUST test set, make sure you don't load the same network in memory every time you compute correspondences between two meshes (which will happen with the naive and simplest way of doing it by calling ```inference/correspondences.py``` iteratively on all the pairs). Good luck :-)

## Training the autoencoder TODO

#### Data 

- TODO

#### Options

* TODO

#### Now you can start training

* First launch a visdom server :

```bash
python -m visdom.server -p 8888
```

* Launch the training. Check out all the options in ```./training/train_correspondences.py``` .

```shell
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 #whichever you want
source activate pytorch-atlasnet
git pull
env=correspondences
python ./training/train_correspondences.py --env $env  |& tee ${env}.txt
```

* Monitor your training on http://localhost:8888/
